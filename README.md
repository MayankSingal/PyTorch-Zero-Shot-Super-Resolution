# PyTorch-Zero-Shot-Super-Resolution
An attempt at a PyTorch Implementation of "Zero-Shot" Super-Resolution using Deep Internal Learning by Shocher et al. CVPR 2018

I have tried to implement everything that has been given in the paper. Results are still lacking, but look promising. 
A lot of the preprocessing code has been taken directly from the original author's amazing repo, which is in tensorflow. 

Things left to do:
  1. Get results close to the paper
  2. Study effects of non-local, other attention based methods on this task.
